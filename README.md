# Food-Hive-Website
This is a restaurant website project built with Bootstrap and css. The menu slider is however created with Slickjs. 
It will be an ongoing project and at completion is intended to have login and authentication functionality using either Firebase Authenticaton or a Nodejs module, 
purchase completion using the Paystack  or Flutterwave API though for the sake of universal workability I may stick with good old Stripe or Paypal.
